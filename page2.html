<td>Skyrim</td>
<td>RPG</td>
<td>10/10</td>
<td>In 2025, this game could easily be considered outdated, but if I had to play one game before I died, it would be The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The rating is very subjective, but it's the game of my life with an incredible atmosphere.</td>

<tr>
<td>Mafia 2</td>
<td>Action</td>
<td>7.5/10</td>
<td>Much less incredible than Skyrim, Mafia 2 is still one of my favorite games of all time. The classic, beloved Mafia plot, the iconic atmosphere of 1950s New York, and the enjoyable soundtrack make it one of the best games in my opinion.</td>

<tr>
<td>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</td>
<td>First-person shooter</td>
<td>8/10</td>
<td>Less groundbreaking than some shooters, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) is still one of my all-time favorites. The gripping campaign, unforgettable characters, and legendary multiplayer maps make it one of the best FPS games ever made.</td>
